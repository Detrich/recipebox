In this project I have created a RecipeBox! Version 1: Basic recipe box where you can see the specific recipes, and authors that you have created in the admin side of the page. I was assisted in this project by Chris Wilson, and Sean Bailey. I also followed along with the class demo that was recorded. Received some guidance from Instructor Joe Kaufeld.

Version 2: Implemented forms into Recipe Box so that recipes and authors can be added from the home url. I also followed along with the demo.
